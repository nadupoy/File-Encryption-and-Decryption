# File Encryption and Decryption:

## Introduction:

- This is a simple file encryption and decryption app that is a personal project
 of mine.

- Tools and technologies used are:
    
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Vanilla JavaScript
    - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
    - Visual Studio Code

- This is my first time using *[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)* on a vanilla
 JavaScript project. <br>
Setting things up has been simple and quick and I'm liking it thus far.
