# File Encryption and Decryption:

## Introduction:

- This is a simple file encryption and decryption app that is a personal project of mine.

- Tools and technologies used are:

  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Vanilla JavaScript
  - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
  - Visual Studio Code

- This is my first time using _[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)_ on a vanilla JavaScript 
project. Setting things up has been simple and quick and I'm liking it thus far. üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ

## Things I Learnt:

### Duplicating Elements:

The default display of the child elements of the`<form>` element was inline block. 
I wanted to insert a `<br>` element after very child element in the form.

My initial approach was to use duplicates of the `<br>` element as shown below:

```javascript
    form.appendChild(label);
    form.appendChild(lineBreak);
    form.appendChild(fileUpload);
    form.appendChild(lineBreak);
    form.appendChild(encryptButton);
```

<br>

However, only one instance of the `<br>` element could only be rendered to HTML:

```HTML
    <form>
        <label>Select file to upload:</label>
        <input type="file" required="true">
        <br>
        <input type="submit" value="ENCRYPT">
    </form>
```

<br><br>

The [`cloneNode()`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsrEF/met_node_clonenode.asp) 
method, used to create copies of elements, resolved this issue:

```javascript
    form.appendChild(label);
    form.appendChild(lineBreak);
    form.appendChild(fileUpload);
    form.appendChild(lineBreak.cloneNode(true));
    form.appendChild(encryptButton);
```

<br>

```HTML
    <form>
        <label>Select file to upload:</label>
        <br>
        <input type="file" required="true">
        <br>
        <input type="submit" value="ENCRYPT">
    </form>
```

### File Input Type:

I initially wanted to use `<input type="file"/>` to encrypt `.txt` files but I 
realised I would need a server to store, perform encryption/decryption and 
download the result. 

In the near future, I hope to program a small server for that using 
[Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en), which I have never worked with apart from 
installing packages on the terminal. It seems this is about to change soon and 
I am looking forward to add it to my resume. üòÅ 

Consequently, for the time being, I opted to work with `<input type="text"`:

```javascript
    const inputText = document.createElement('INPUT');
    . . .
    inputText.setAttribute('type', 'text');
    inputText.setAttribute('maxLength', '100');
    inputText.setAttribute('placeholder', 'Type message here');
    inputText.setAttribute('required', 'true');
    inputText.setAttribute('size', '30');
```

<br>

```HTML
    <input type="text" maxlength="100" placeholder="Type message here" required="true" size="30">
```

### Using an NPM Package:

To perform the encryption/decryption I downloaded a package called 
[Encryptly](https://www.npmjs.com/package/encryptly?activeTab=readme) 
from the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).

However, I encountered the following error when using it in my code:

```
    Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined
```

I discovered the cause of this was using `require` in a non-Node.js environment, 
in this case the browser, hence it was not recognized. This was highlighted in 
[this](https://rollbar.com/blog/referenceerror-require-is-not-defined-javascript/#) 
article by the team at [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/#).

Unfortunately, I was unable to resolve the above error. üòë

Since I am using vanilla JavaScript, I opted to write my own function for encryption 
and decryption and not use any node packages. After watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuyzuNBFWxQ) 
overview of Cryptography by [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship), 
I decided to use **Symmetric Encryption**.
